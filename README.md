# Android Challenge

### Description

This is my Git repository for Myriad Mobile's Android Challenge project.

### Testing

Testing should be done in Android Studio. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Issue the terminal command `git clone https://github.com/The-PPWD/AndroidChallenge.git`

        After the 'git clone,' there is a new folder in your working directory.

2. Open this folder in Android Studio.

3. Run by going to `Run > Run 'app'`

        Here you have the option to choose between a physical and a virtual device.

4. In a moment, the app will launch on your device.
